In 2023, I graduated from NC State University, with a double major in Biological Sciences and Psychology.
During college, I gained a passion for data, developing my problem-solving skills, strengthing my interpersonal communication, and upholding client confidentiality. These experiences sparked a keen interest in data security. This led me to delve deeply into cybersecurity, where I learned foundational principles and earned relevant certifications. I have hands-on experience with various cybersecurity tools and techniques, including vulnerability exploitation and using Burp Suite, which has further enhanced my expertise in the field.
